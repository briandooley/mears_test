      "description": "Computer programs are the most complicated things that humans make. They must be perfect, which is hard for us because we are not perfect. Programming is thought to be a &quot;head&quot; activity, but there is a lot of &quot;gut&quot; involved. Indeed, it may be the gut that gives us the insight necessary for solving hard problems. But gut messes us up when it come to matters of style.\r\n\r\nThe systems in our brains that make us vulnerable to advertising and propaganda also influence our programming styles. This talk looks systematically at the development of a programming style that specifically improves the reliability of programs. The examples are given in JavaScript, a language with an uncommonly large number of bad parts, but the principles are applicable to all languages.",

Operating systems are event driven via messages, the internet is message driven via HTTP/SMTP etc. yet developers rarely use messaging as a solution to complex architectural problems like threading, shuttling data between applications (IPC) and distributing load across machines. In the last few years, ZeroMQ has become mainstream and is an excellent implementation of broker-less messaging with bindings for 20+ languages including C, C++, Java, .NET, Python and Most OS&#39;es including Linux, Windows, OS X. IT is open source LGPL free software and has a large user base. This is significant for server side implementation, because rigid development design often breaks when it needs to scale.

Did someone hand you a legacy DB app and now you have to modify the database schema?\r\n\r\nThis session will cover the basics of designing and setting up a database schema. We&#39;ll start with defining a few common business scenarios, build out some tables, create relationships and then go through usage, pitfalls, problems and design tradeoffs. As a veteran of many, many database-driven projects for consumer desktop software applications, websites and enterprise software systems, the database design plays a crucial role in the success of your project.\r\n\r\nWe&#39;ll run through some real-life examples and issues such as:\r\n\r\n* Creating a new table\r\n\r\n* Choosing data types\r\n\r\n* Normalization (and when to denormalize)\r\n\r\n* Types of relationships\r\n\r\n* Referential integrity\r\n\r\n* Join/relationship tables\r\n\r\n* 1-to-many, many-to-many\r\n\r\n* ...and then how to actually use these structures in your application\r\n\r\nNote: while the examples will focus on SQL Server, the techniques and SQL code will work for virtually any SQL database.\r\n\r\nNote2: If you want help solving specific problems, please check out my other session on Database Wart Removal.\r\n\r\nPlease use the &quot;Email Speaker&quot; button to send me your questions, where you&#39;re at with DB design now, or any other material so I can tailor the presentation to your needs!",

We will also cover the practical use of regular expressions by demonstrating best practices for writing, testing, performance optimization, readability, compilation, and design guidelines. We will use the .NET framework&#39;s flavor of regular expressions in the demos. However since .NET regular expressions like most regular expression libraries are Perl compatible, the syntax presented will generally work with a wide range of regular expression packages.

As of April &#39;12 we have our major services running on Scala, and we could not be happier. \r\n\r\nI&#39;ll talk about the strategic &amp; tactical rationale, gradual introduction to the new language, cultivating experts and mentoring junior developers.  We will also cover the common roadblocks the leaders may run into, addressing the concerns of engineers and stakeholders, and building an engineering culture that facilitates innovation and talent growth. Please note that this talk is not a Ruby/Java/Scala religious debate - we believe in using the best tool for the job; and what works for us may not work for every org (which is where the culture comes in).\r\n\r\nMy team&#39;s journey from &quot;Holy crap! This looks academic and scary!&quot; to &quot;Let me whip out a service by EOD today&quot; in a matter of months is something I am very proud of, and would love to share it with fellow developer community.",

But it&#39;s not just for the frontend.  Javascript can also help power the backend, giving your web app server-side persistence and more.  Whether you&#39;re developing a webapp or an iOS/Android app using PhoneGap with Javascript, you can add out-of-the-box server-side persistence in minutes. \r\n\r\nLeave the talk learning how to add server side persistence to your Javascript powered app with StackMob&#39;s free service with its open-source JS SDK.  You&#39;ll have a backend running in &lt; 15 minutes.  Authentication, Geolocation, localstorage, access controls, and other HTML5 features are built-in.  You&#39;ll also learn how you can write optional custom Java/Scala/Clojure code and upload it to StackMob to run it server side.  You can even call that server side code from your Javascript.  Need a place to host it?  You can host your web app on StackMob too.\r\n\r\nWe&#39;ll be using the free (but full featured) version of StackMob&#39;s service in this talk.

Unit testing intends to do just that: take a unit of your code, and verify that it behaves properly. Unfortunately, in ârealâ software, classes interact with other parts of the system, which makes testing in isolation difficult.\r\nMocking is a technique designed to overcome that issue: replacing dependencies by Mocks, lightweight versions of the âreal thingâ, allows you to validate the interactions of a class with its âcollaboratorsâ.\r\nI will discuss reasons you should care about mocks, illustrate how you would go about addressing them by rolling your own mocks & stubs, and demonstrate free, open-source frameworks, Moq, Rhino.Mocks and NSubstitute, which greatly simplify the process. Mocks and Stubs can sound intimidating â the goal of this presentation is to demystify the topic and give you a clear understanding of what they are, where they can help you, and to give you a good quick-start so that you can productively use them in your own code.",

Of course Python can do XML as well as multithreading, SQL/databases, GUIs, client/server systems and networking (heard of Twisted?), GIS/ESRI, QA/test, automation frameworks, plus system administration tasks too! If Python doesn&#39;t do what you want, you can extend it in C/C++, Java, or C# (and even VB.NET)! Have you noticed the huge growth in the number of jobs on Monster and Dice that list Python as a desired/required skill?\r\n\r\nPython can do everything Java, C/C++/C#, Ruby, PHP, and Perl can do, but it&#39;s more intuitive &amp; fun! You can code as fast as you think! Because of Python&#39;s simple yet robust syntax, it&#39;s a great tool to teach programming (for those ready to move beyond Alice and Scratch) with as well as a solid (first) language to learn for non-programmers and other technical staff. You don&#39;t need a compute science major to using Python! Come find out why Google, Yahoo!, Disney, Cisco, YouTube, BitTorrent, LucasFilm/ILM, NASA, Ubuntu, Slide, and Red Hat all use Python!

      "description": "Functional programming is one of the tools programmers use to solve some of the problems plaguing us today - complexity and concurrency being just two examples.  But this style of programming requires a dramatic shift from imperative programming in how one thinks about the problems at hand.  What if there was a programming language that allowed coders to play with functional programming concepts, without requiring them to completely shift their thought processes?  Python is such a language, and has borrowed many aspects from functional programming languages (such as Haskell) and has incorporated them into its libraries and common usage.  For those imperative programmers looking to experiment with functional languages, Python serves as an ideal âgateway,â allowing programmers to explore many of the ideas important to functional programming and giving them a leg up when it comes to moving into a more fully-functional language like Haskell.\r\n\r\nThis talk will introduce Python and Haskell programming languages and show how Python can be used as an intermediary to learning the basics of not just Haskell, but functional programming as a whole.",

Inspired by an article on Artificial Bee Colony algorithms, an optimization algorithm based on the intelligent foraging behaviour of honey bee swarms, I decided as a learning project to convert it from C# into a F# library, Bumblebee, which is available open-source at http://bumblebee.codeplex.com.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, I want to do 4 things:\r\n\r\n1) cover the basics of Artificial Bee Colony algorithms, and illustrate what problems it can help solve,  \r\n\r\n2) solve a problem together with Bumblebee, and use it as a F# primer,  \r\n\r\n3) open the hood and discuss some of the design aspects (making the API both F# and C# friendly, using the Task Parallel Library for parallelism, using OO and functional styles together, unit testing...)  \r\n\r\n4) share my learning experience transitioning from a C#-mindset to thinking F#.  \r\n\r\nThis talk is particularly relevant for C# developers who are F#-curious!

We&#39;ll explore HTML5 through demos on mobile devices and desktops, and also look at code samples, with excerpts from two HTML5 books (2012 and 2013) and links to some of my open source projects.\r\n\r\nSession #1 starts with a demo of pure CSS3 3D animation effects on multiple devices (an iPad3, an Asus Prime Android ICS tablet, a Sprint S 4G phone with Android ICS, and a Macbook).  We&#39;ll discuss the key code concepts, and then you&#39;ll see examples of CSS3 and jQuery that create unusual animation effects.\r\n\r\nYou&#39;ll see demos of CSS Custom Filters (aka CSS Shaders prior to 09/24/2012), which create effects that were previously only possible in WebGL, and at least three related open source projects (CSS3, jQuery/CSS3, and CSS custom filters) provide additional code samples.\r\n\r\nFinally, we&#39;ll look at some demos of CSS Exclusions and CSS Flow Regions (time permitting), which are two recent features of CSS3.  A basic understanding of HTML and CSS, and some jQuery can also be useful for this session, which wraps up with a raffle of an HTML5 book.  Please note that this session is similar to my presentation during OWC (07/2012) at PayPal.\r\n\r\nSupplemental bonus: spherical coordinates and cylindrical coordinates both explained in under two minutes (don&#39;t be afraid).\r\nRecent book: http://www.amazon.com/HTML5-Canvas-CSS3-Graphics-Primer/dp/1936420341 \r\nupcoming book: http://www.merclearning.com/titles/jQuery_CSS3_HTML5_Mobile.html",

Origins of Logic \r\ntheory dates back to about 300 B.C. when Aristotle founded\r\nFormal Logic to bring rigor to logical inferencing.

If you have fear, uncertainty, or doubt about exception safety or just want to see the best practices for using exceptions in C++, this session is for you. Weâll start with âWhat is the problem we are trying to solve?â and discuss alternatives, acknowledge the challenges associated with exception usage, and cover some well-meaning but misguided attempts at safety. I will then present a set of guidelines that are the basis for safe exception usage and solid implementation techniques, including how to transition from an exception-unsafe legacy code base.\r\n\r\nWhen we are finished you will know how to produce code that is easier to write, easier to understand, faster to execute, and 100% robust in the face of exceptions.\r\n\r\nThis update of last year&#39;s talk covers substantially more material including C++11.

      "description": "Are you 100% confident that your code is exception-safe?\r\n\r\nSafe usage of exceptions is a non-trivial problem that the industry has struggled with for the better part of two decades. If you have fear, uncertainty, or doubt about exception safety or just want to see the best practices for using exceptions in C++, this session is for you. Weâll start with âWhat is the problem we are trying to solve?â and discuss alternatives, acknowledge the challenges associated with exception usage, and cover some well-meaning but misguided attempts at safety. I will then present a set of guidelines that are the basis for safe exception usage and solid implementation techniques, including how to transition from an exception-unsafe legacy code base.\r\n\r\nWhen we are finished you will know how to produce code that is easier to write, easier to understand, faster to execute, and 100% robust in the face of exceptions.\r\n\r\nThis update of last year&#39;s talk covers substantially more material including C++11.

However, no nation with an active military force is in a state of perpetual war. This leads to a drop in soldiersâ fitness and combat readiness over a period of time. \r\nNow imagine human soldiers are replaced with humanoid robots that have been trained to pick out enemies and finish them off with precision accuracy. There is no emotion or lethargy in those wires, no fatigue in those motors and there will never be a case of lack of practice. \r\nThis talk presents the techniques in Artificial Intelligence that have been developed on a humanoid robot to pick up a gun and practice shooting. The training was done using a NERF gun. In less than 5 tries, the robot achieves an accuracy of greater than 95% on stationery targets. That is a success rate greater than trained marksmen. Future work involves dealing with moving targets, especially those that would do everything to avoid getting hit. The code has been written in C++, with simulations done in MATLAB.  The algorithms presented can be easily implemented in all languages on robots with compatible hardware.",

As the community is building up experience with the new features, new stylistic ways of using them are emerging. These styles (a.k.a. idioms) give the new language its unique flavor. This talk will present emerging idioms of using rvalue references -- a marquee feature of C++11 as many renowned experts call it. You will see how C++11 opens new possibilities to design class interfaces. Finally, you will learn some advanced use-cases of rvalue references which will likely make you feel something amiss in this flagship feature of C++11. (This talk will assume some basic knowledge of rvalue references, move semantics, and perfect forwarding in C++11. If these concepts are new to you, I highly recommend Jon Kalb&#39;s session just before this one.)",

The approach relies on a careful definition of a \"data race\", which is treated as an error,  and a guarantee of expected behavior in the absence of such data races.\r\n\r\nWe'll quickly introduce some of the thread support features in C++11 and then describe the rules for programming with shared variables.  We'll illustrate the finer points of the \"data race\" definition by going through a number of small examples.  Much of this is also applicable to C11.",

The user should be able to undo back to the creation of a document, even if it was previously saved or copied, and redo back to the latest state. If the power failed, when the user ran the software again it should redo any changes made since the last save so the document is back in the latest state. \r\n\r\nThe design we eventually came up with is deceptively simple. As a bonus, it helped us figure out how to design the model layer so it is very stable. \r\n\r\nThe implementation and examples are in C# .NET but the design may be applicable to other languages and runtimes.",

Users expect a rich, interactive and dynamic user experience on a wide variety of clients including mobile devices. Applications must be highly scalable, highly available and run on cloud environments. Organizations often want to frequently roll out updates, even multiple times a day. Consequently, itâs no longer adequate to develop simple, monolithic web applications that serve up HTML to desktop browsers.\r\nIn this talk we describe the limitations of a monolithic architecture. You will learn how to use the scale cube to decompose your application into a set of narrowly focused, independently deployable back-end services and an HTML 5 client. We will also discuss the role of technologies such as NodeJS and AMQP brokers. You will learn how a modern PaaS such as Cloud Foundry simplifies the development and deployment of this style of application.",

Large distributed systems often employ two or more communication patterns. Using a single middleware that supports multiple communication patterns is a very cost-effective way of developing and maintaining large distributed systems. This talk will begin with an introduction of Data Distribution Service (DDS) â an OMG standard â that supports data-centric publish-subscribe communication for real-time distributed systems. DDS separates state management and distribution from application logic and supports discoverable data models. The talk will then describe how RTI Connext Messaging goes beyond vanilla DDS and implements various communication patterns including request-reply, command-response, and guaranteed delivery. You will also learn how these patterns can be combined to create interesting variations when the underlying substrate is as powerful as DDS. Weâll also discuss APIs for creating high-performance applications using the request-reply communication pattern.",

But most non-development groups (such as Web Administrators, Production Support, Security, Testing, and Users/Stake Holders) inside the enterprise are not only far from agile, that are not trying to move to be more agile. I start with a refresher on Scrum, and then use real experiences from large enterprise development projects to teach you how to effectively work with non-agile teams. Instead of trying to \"convert\" them, I discuss strategies to adapt to their needs while remaining agile in the development realm.",

Trello is a free and easy collaborative tool that can be used for anything by anyone. Really! Organize it all, together. In one glance, know what&#39;s being worked on and who&#39;s working on what. In this session, we will talk about how to write an Objective-C API Wrapper with an overview of the open-source code (https://github.com/vincemansel/ios-trello). For those that love hands-on learning, we will install an Xcode project (ios4trello) and test the API from the ground up (You will need an account at trello.com). Along the way, we will touch on HTTP, REST and JSON and how to integrate modern APIs into your iOS projects. To wrap, we will demo ShowPlan, an iPad IDE for collaborative/creative production planning that builds on ios-trello. Afterwards, you can apply your knowledge, collaborate and write/test code for ios-trello which, by the way, also uses trello and github for software project management.",

These days, you&#39;re overwhelmed - you&#39;re hiring at a crazy rate, your code is getting wildly complicated, your time is being consumed by higher level problems and your product is getting more functional by the hour, all the while watching your bug tracker balloon with problems on the site. You wish you had some kind of testing in place, and you started adding a little bit but it&#39;s nothing compared to the rate at which people are adding code - and you&#39;re being asked for help so much that you barely have time to code yourself. How can you slow down this out of control train? Learn how Box built a culture of quality and reliability, the processes that were put in place and how we created an awareness around testing, resilience, prioritizing the removal of technical debt and got both engineering and product leaders on board.",

      "description": "The C++ static type system is beneficial in many ways; it can, however, also be a straitjacket. Is there a rationale for dynamic type layer on top of a statically typed language like C++?  Given both historical (ANSI C union and void*, MS COM Variant, boost::[variant, any, lexical_cast]) and recent (boost::type_erasure, Facebook folly::dynamic) development trends, the answer is a resounding &quot;yes&quot;.\r\n\r\nThis presentation is based on Poco::Dynamic::Var (aka Poco::DynamicAny) - a dynamic-typing set of C++ classes; furthermore, it will show the simplicity and practical advantages of mapping ad-hoc generated data sets of unknown type, size, and structure to C++ data structures.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, the presentation demonstrates how to:\r\n\r\n(1) Execute a generic &quot;SELECT * FROM Table&quot;;\r\n(2) Dynamically map returned data (row/column count and types) to C++ data structures at runtime;\r\n(3) Format the result as [XML, JSON, HTML, your-favorite-data-format-here];\r\n(4) Stream the resulting formatted string to std::ostream compliant HTTP socket stream.\r\n\r\nSurely, this must be very complicated to do in C++, right?  Not at all - we&#39;ll demonstrate all of the above done with a single line of code and then peek under the hood to see where/how does the magic happen. Portable? Of course. Scalable? You bet - it&#39;s C++!  The content of this presentation fits perfectly into modern AJAXian trends and we&#39;ll prove it with an ExtJS example; it prompts re-thinking of the rationale for (a) employing dynamic languages on the server side or (b) polluting HTML with server-side code.",

That is why at Google I/O this summer, we launched 2 new initiatives to help users get up-to-speed in a user-friendly self-paced online learning environment: googledevelopers.blogspot.com/2012/06/google-launches-new-developer-education.html\r\n\r\nGoogle Developers Academy (developers.google.com/academy) provides online classes to help you learn one aspect of using a Google API. We&#39;ve launched with material covering a variety of services including Google App Engine, Google Drive, YouTube, and our many advertising APIs. This is just the start, as we&#39;ll add new lessons regularly. \r\n\r\nGoogle Developers University Consortium (developers.google.com/university) is a community for those in academia using Google APIs for instruction or research. Teachers &amp; researchers can share their open materials &amp; exchange ideas with other faculty worldwide. Users can make announcements about their work, highlight successes, publish research, etc.\r\n\r\nGoogle also has a diverse set of teams addressing various needs in the technology &amp; education space. Programs available from these teams include: K-20 education pedagogy, encouraging careers in the science &amp; engineering disciplines, research, (awards &amp; programs for university faculty &amp; grad students), student internships, etc.\r\n\r\nThis talk serves as an overview of many of our developer &amp; education programs.

Faced with supporting multiple devices, a patchwork of languages, and various technologies, it takes a team of experts to develop, configure, maintain and run Web and mobile apps. Introducing the concept of \"it just works out of the box\" and what that means for Web and mobile applications, I will show how less lines of code can produce better apps -- and all in the same JavaScript language used everywhere.",

At the heart of every Wakanda application is the data model and as that name would suggest it is the definition of all the data classes, attributes and relationships. But it is more than that. It is meant to store all your business rules, business logic, everything that is stored in one logical place so that everything interacts with the data model, like classes, or scopes, which control the pieces make it to the browser or events on entities on initialization, or validations when saving an entity. You can define data class methods, which are in essence stored procedures, you can define those as a collection, entity level or class level. You can even used inherited data classes you have a degree of hierachy to the data in your model. You can use restricting queries which control access to entities based on certian conditions you want to set. All of that make up a Wakanda data model.",

A cross platform mobile application is identical to a native application except it utilizes one code base to deploy the application to multiple different platforms. Why does this matter? It matters because it allows for a significant reduction in the amount of time and effort required to develop an application by not having to write it in the native language of each platform. It also allows for the use of the widely available and more cost effective skill sets of HTML, JS, and CSS for development of applications.\r\n\r\nAdobe PhoneGap also provides tools for building, debugging and emulation.  \r\n\r\nCome find out more about how Adobe PhoneGap can make developing cross platform applications easy!",
